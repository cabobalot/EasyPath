# Tuning kP

0.07 should be approximately the kP value that you use - 340, 2791, 5254 all used similar values in 2018.
I recommend providing it a simple arc, like a center switch auto, at speeds varying between 0.4 and 0.7.
While it's driving, look for any wobbliness. If it is wobbling, then the kP value is likely too high. If it doesn't turn enough,
it is likely too low. Finding a sweet spot doesn't take too long, but **your kP will change as you
change your robot weight.**

In the future, I'll try to add videos of poorly-tuned or well-tuned robots and what their behaviors look
like.
