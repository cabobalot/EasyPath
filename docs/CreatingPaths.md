# Creating Paths

Currently I am in progress of re-writing the pathing site to be much more manageable and less buggy.
For now, you can use the old pathing site, written by a former 340 student: http://paths.rpappa.com/

In the "Code" block, click "Old Style". Alter your path in the way that you see fit. Copy to
clipboard and paste it into your code, like shown below.

One problem that will be fixed in the future: Path site generates a class named `PathSegment`, but
EasyPath uses a class named `Path`. Simply rename `PathSegment` to `Path` and it should work.
